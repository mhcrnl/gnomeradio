Yeah, yet another gtk+ radiotuner *ggg*
Don't ask me why i wrote it, just thought it would be fun.

Installation is the same as always: 
./configure 
make
make install
make uninstall (if you don't like it)

Note: You now need intltool to compile gnomeradio.

The configure-script should detect lirc automagically, but if
it doesn't, give --enable-lirc a try.

For more info on lirc, check README.lirc.
For more info on the recording functionality check README.recording

That's it, thanks to Gerd Knorr (xawtv), cause i borrowed quite some
code of radio.c which is included in xawtv, and all the guys from
gnome-i18n mailing-list who were so kind to translate gnomeradio in 
various languages.

If you find any bugs, have comments or proposals on improvements
fell free to contact me (mfcn@gmx.de)

Greets,
Jörgen
